# Nyz
Nyz is a blogging platform where you can share content about anything that you think it's interesting to share with other people in the community. The platform allows you to post, edit your posts, follow users from the community and read their content!

## How Nyz works?

First of all, you need an account in order to access our home page. You can create your own account by clicking in the underlined "Register" in the end of the Login form.

You need to write your personal information inside the fields of the form.

After finishing your registration, if everything is ok, you are redirected to the home page where you can see the posts made by people that are followed by you.

If you haven't followed someone yet you can access the search page where you can find all the available users.

After following them, their posts will be available at the home page.

Also, if you have any ideia and want to share this with everyone you can create a post by clicking in "Add post" inside the page header. You need to add title, description and the post content in order to post something.

You can delete your post as well if you feel the need! Just click in "Profile" inside the page header then you'll be redirected to your profile page.
